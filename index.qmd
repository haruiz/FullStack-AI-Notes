# Preface {.unnumbered}

This website is a compilation of notes, tutorials, and code examples used in the "Fullstack AI" course offered at Autonoma de Occidente University in Cali, Colombia. The course is part of the AI Specialization Program and aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the design and development of AI systems, covering both theoretical and practical aspects. The course is designed to be accessible to students with varying backgrounds, including those without any prior experience in AI.
 
This course was created and developed by Professor Henry A. Ruiz, PhD, who currently works as a research scientist at Texas A&M University. The course is based on the author's experience in developing AI systems for a wide range of applications, including agriculture, healthcare, IoT, and robotics. The course is designed to provide students with a solid foundation in AI concepts and techniques, as well as practical experience in developing AI systems using popular tools and libraries.
